The endpoint affected is /api/v1/Voucher/Factory/saveVoucher/
Validation can be tested during a transition period using the HTTP header X-Version: 1.1.
Status Quo:
Many inputs are accepted via the API that are not correct from an accounting point of view. Invalid values are accepted and mandatory information that is required for correct accounting is missing.
Future:
Validation and error message in case of invalid input based on API documentation.</description></item><item><title>Removing public access of the Doc Server</title><link>https://tech.sevdesk.com/api_news/posts/removing-docreactor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 11:18:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://tech.sevdesk.com/api_news/posts/removing-docreactor/</guid><description>The Doc Server (docreactor.sevdesk.de), which can be used to generate PDFs for invoices among other things, will no longer be directly accessible.

We started with Php and Zend 8 years ago. We adapted Zend to fit our needs with a great persistence framework. We also added a lot of developer productivity features that made our lives easier. In terms of architecture the system is a pretty bigish monolith - perfect for a small team that we were a couple of years ago.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the sevDesk Tech Radar</title><link>https://tech.sevdesk.com/posts/introducing-the-sevdesk-tech-radar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 11:58:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://tech.sevdesk.com/posts/introducing-the-sevdesk-tech-radar/</guid><description>We recently created the sevDesk Tech Radar. But why did we create it? And how can it help you and sevDesk? Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look&amp;hellip;
What problem does the Tech Radar solve? Tech companies are often a black box of technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for applicants to see which technologies a company uses. But it is also hard for employees to know what technologies are ready for use, and which are not.</description></item><item><title>No customer left behind.

Our teams now have end-to-end responsibility which makes them much more autonomous. If you look at the frontend of sevDesk you’ll see different parts like “Invoices”, “ERP” and many more. One team now manages exactly one part of our app - from frontend over backend down to the database.
The teams themselves consist of members with different specialities: Product Owner, Agile Coach, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev and also UX/UI.</description></item><item><title>Time to give something back - our blog begins</title><link>https://tech.sevdesk.com/posts/time-to-give-something-back-our-blog-begins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 11:58:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://tech.sevdesk.com/posts/time-to-give-something-back-our-blog-begins/</guid><description>Hey everyone!
A journey starts sevDesk was founded in 2013. We started with that tiny idea of making accounting simpler for small businesses.
Back then we were not sure about how to make money. In the first years we physically installed sevDesk on servers of our customers. We also tried to sell whitelabled versions of sevDesk. And we tried to sell sevDesk as online application.
In the end the online application (aka SaaS application) really worked for us, and this is what sevDesk is now.</description></item></channel></rss>
