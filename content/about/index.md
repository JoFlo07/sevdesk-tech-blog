sevDesk is a company that makes accounting for small buisnesses as enjoyable as a great afternoon at the beach.

We are a tech company and we love what we do.

That's why we are running this blog. To give some insights. Discuss ideas how we work. And maybe inspire people with some lessons we learned in the last years :)

We are growing and are hiring - also remotely. Check out our [career pages](https://sevdesk.de/karriere/).

If you got any comments or feedback for us feel free to reach out to us ([Tobin](mailto:tobin@sevdesk.de) and [Raphael](mailto:raphael.bauer@sevdesk.de)). Looking forward to hearing from you!
