Hey everyone!

# A journey starts

sevDesk was founded in 2013. We started with that tiny idea of making accounting simpler for small businesses.

Back then we were not sure about how to make money. In the first years we physically installed sevDesk on servers of our customers. We also tried to sell whitelabled versions of sevDesk. And we tried to sell sevDesk as online application.

In the end the online application (aka SaaS application) really worked for us, and this is what sevDesk is now.

2013 - Fabian and Marco - founders of sevDesk. Not much was clear back then...

# Technology changes

Technically we moved from php to php with rest endpoints and Angular 1. Then we moved to the cloud. Right now we are transitioning from php to Kotlin/Spring Boot and from Angular to React/Typescript.

We also grew our dev and product teams massively. Two years ago we were only 15 devs - in 2021 we were 50, and we plan to double our engineer count roughly every year from now on.

We are looking forward to the exciting years to come :)

# Stories to be told

Over the years we benefited quite a lot from blogpost of other companies. Now it’s time to give something back and report from our department. There are a lot of learnings over the last years. Things to share. Decisions we made. Fuckups to report.

As usual - if you got feedback for us - let us now  Happy to hearing from you!

 

Marco (CTO and Founder) and Tobin (IT Architect)
