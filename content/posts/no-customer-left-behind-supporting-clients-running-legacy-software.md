## A problem discovered by the C-Level
sevDesk is regularly holding management offsites with C-Level and VPs. A big topic in these management offsites is how to make sevDesk even more visible by improving the value we deliver to customers.

From a bird's eye perspective sevDesk is already very successful in the German and Austrian markets. We are the #1 accounting software in many categories and clients love what we do.

But the C-Level identified a problem.

Many potential clients cannot use sevDesk right now.

How is that possible?

## Customers we cannot support - yet
Our target customers are small to medium businesses and also tax accountants. Many of our customers are frontrunning early adopters of technology. Using sevDesk to manage their Shopify sites. Running their business in a fully digital way on their iPads.

But many potential customers don’t use the latest crazy tech stack. 

![Internet Explorer Retro Gif](/img/ie_retro.gif)

Think of the car repair shop running an old Windows 95 installation. The beverages shop with the Windows Server 2003 cashier system. Or tax accountants using Windows XP with Datev.

Nobody of those potential clients is able to use sevDesk right now. According to our research there is a potential of around 70.000 customers in Germany alone that fall into that category.

## Being customer-centric is at our core
Our approach is to listen and then to provide solutions. In that example the clients need a solution to run sevDesk on systems like Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows ME. For us as cloud software provider it means adding support for Internet Explorer 10 down to 6.

With our current modern platform (React, Javascript, Typescript, Spring Boot, Java, Kotlin) we cannot make that happen. 

Does being a customer centric company now mean that we have to teach customers to update their IT hardware and software?

We don’t think so.

## Technology is the answer
Marco, founder and CTO, had a great idea: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could cross-compile our React application to support vintage browser versions?”

We did exactly that. We created a library to cross-compile our codebase automatically to Javascript and JQuery 1.5 from 2011. That allows us to support Internet Explorer versions as low as IE 7. Our cross compilation framework is called Lirpa 1 (Longterm Integration And Retrospective Patch Application 1). 

We are happy to announce that we’ll release sevDesk support for IE 7 (with IE 6 upcoming) in April 22. Great times ahead!

We are hiring for Lipra 2
The next version of Lirpa is already planned and we are hiring. Lirpa 2’s goal is to add support for Internet Explorer 6 and Safari versions running on the PowerPC architecture.

If you are interested then feel free to reach out to us. We are looking for:

- [Frontend / Fullstack heroes: React, Typescript, but also a nag for JQuery 1.5](https://sevdesk.de/karriere/entwicklung/)
- [Backend / Fullstack heroes that love to work with Java / Kotlin and Spring Boot + IIS4 (Windows NT)](https://sevdesk.de/karriere/entwicklung/)
- [Designers interested in 90s vintage application design](https://sevdesk.de/karriere/entwicklung/)

Either in one of our offices in Vienna or Offenburg or remotely in Austria / Germany / France.

## Innovation made by sevDesk
This is how innovation is working at sevDesk - Great insights by our C-Level and Marketing. Technically flawless execution by our engineers and happy customers running sevDesk on Windows XP and Internet Explorer 6.
