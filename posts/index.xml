A journey starts sevDesk was founded in 2013. We started with that tiny idea of making accounting simpler for small businesses.
Back then we were not sure about how to make money. In the first years we physically installed sevDesk on servers of our customers. We also tried to sell whitelabled versions of sevDesk. And we tried to sell sevDesk as online application.
In the end the online application (aka SaaS application) really worked for us, and this is what sevDesk is now.</description></item></channel></rss>
