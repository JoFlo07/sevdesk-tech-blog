Not much was clear back then&mldr;</p><h2 id=technology-changes>Technology changes</h2><p>Technically we moved from php to php with rest endpoints and Angular 1. Then we moved to the cloud. Right now we are transitioning from php to Kotlin/Spring Boot and from Angular to React/Typescript.</p><p>We also grew our dev and product teams massively. Two years ago we were only 15 devs - in 2021 we were 50, and we plan to double our engineer count roughly every year from now on.</p><p>We are looking forward to the exciting years to come :)</p><h2 id=stories-to-be-told>Stories to be told</h2><p>Over the years we benefited quite a lot from blogpost of other companies. Now it’s time to give something back and report from our department. There are a lot of learnings over the last years. Things to share. Decisions we made. Fuckups to report.</p><p>As usual - if you got feedback for us - let us now Happy to hearing from you!</p><p> </p><p>Marco (CTO and Founder) and Tobin (IT Architect)</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray"><small class="f6 db tc">© 2022 <b>sevDesk</b>., All Rights Reserved</small><div class="f6 db tc"><a href=/posts/no-customer-left-behind-supporting-clients-running-legacy-software/><img src=/img/ie_retro.gif height=40px>
