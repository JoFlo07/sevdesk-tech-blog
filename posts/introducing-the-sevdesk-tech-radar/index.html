But why did we create it? And how can it help you and sevDesk? Let&rsquo;s have a look&mldr;</p><h2 id=what-problem-does-the-tech-radar-solve>What problem does the Tech Radar solve?</h2><p>Tech companies are often a black box of technologies. It&rsquo;s hard for applicants to see which technologies a company uses. But it is also hard for employees to know what technologies are ready for use, and which are not. In the worst case a zoo of technologies emerges that results in single points of failure and massive frustration.</p><p>There is a simple fix - Tech Radar to the rescue!</p><h2 id=what-is-a-tech-radar>What is a Tech Radar</h2><p>The Tech Radar lists technologies of a company in flight-radar-like fashion. The radar then states whether a technology is &ldquo;Active&rdquo;, &ldquo;In Trial&rdquo;, &ldquo;In Evaluation&rdquo; or &ldquo;On Hold&rdquo;.</p><p>The layout of the Tech Radar also shows four segments to make things more concise. In case of sevDesk these are &ldquo;Coding and Frameworks&rdquo;, &ldquo;Monitoring, Logging and Security&rdquo;, &ldquo;CI, CD, Infrastructure and Automation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Platform And Services&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=benefits-of-a-tech-radar>Benefits of a Tech Radar</h2><p>The Tech Radar&rsquo;s superpower is that it shows a non-trivial amount of information in a very concise way.</p><p>You want to know what technologies a company likes or dislikes? One look at the Tech Radar will tell.</p><img src=/img/sevdesk-tech-radar.jpg alt=demo class=img-responsive><h2 id=who-is-interested-in-the-tech-radar>Who is interested in the Tech Radar?</h2><p>The Tech Radar is of interest for at least two groups: Applicants and employees.</p><p>For applicants the Tech Radar is a nice way to see if the company and you are a match. If you are interested in Typescript and React, but the company has both technologies &ldquo;On Hold&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s maybe
not the right company for you. But if the company has many technologies on the plate that you are interested in - then it totally makes sense to apply for a job there.</p><p>For employees the Tech Radar is a good way to steer technology decisions. A zoo of technologies is interesting and nice. But a zoo can kill a company if you only got few people that know about a technology. If a technology is no longer used then put it &ldquo;On Hold&rdquo; - and signal to everyone inside the company that that particular technology should no longer be used.</p><h2 id=how-do-we-keep-things-updated>How do we keep things updated?</h2><p>At sevDesk we update our Tech Radar once a quarter in a specific meeting. Most of our lead developers are joining. We then discuss current technologies. Experiences with tech &ldquo;In Trial&rdquo; and benefits of moving deprecated technologies to &ldquo;On Hold&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=how-to-create-your-own-tech-radar>How to create your own Tech Radar</h2><p>There are a couple of ways how you can create your own Tech Radar. Two common ways are <a href=https://radar.thoughtworks.com/>Thoughtwork&rsquo;s Tech Radar builder</a> and <a href=https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar>Zalando&rsquo;s Tech Radar library</a>.</p><p><a href=https://tech-radar.sevdesk.com>We are using Zalando&rsquo;s Tech Radar as it has everything</a> we need - and we can maintain it directly as Javascript file with versioning.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>The Tech Radar is a great way to get an overview of the technologies a company uses. And it&rsquo;s great to
steer technology choices inside the company.</p><p>sevDesk got a Tech Radar that&rsquo;s regularly updated and it&rsquo;s beneficial for most companies.</p><h2 id=more>More</h2><ul><li>Our current <a href=https://tech-radar.sevdesk.com>sevDesk Tech Radar</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar>Zalando&rsquo;s Tech Radar open source library</a></li><li><a href=https://radar.thoughtworks.com/>Thoughtwork&rsquo;s Tech Radar builder</a></li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray"><small class="f6 db tc">Â© 2023 <b>sevDesk</b>., All Rights Reserved</small><div class="tc mt3"><a href=https://sevdesk.com/legal-notice/ title="Legal Notice / Imprint" class="f6 dib ph2 link mid-gray dim">Legal Notice / Imprint</a>
